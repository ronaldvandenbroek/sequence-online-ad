# Beyond the Norm: Online Anomaly Detection of Prefixes in Event Streams using Autoencoders
This repository contains code and resources for performing anomaly detection in event streams using autoencoders with two different encoding methods: 
1. **One-Hot Encoding**: In this approach, each event is represented as a one-hot vector.

2. **Word2Vec Encoding**: This method uses Word2Vec embeddings to represent events and their attributes.
