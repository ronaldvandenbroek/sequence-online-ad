# Beyond the Norm: Online Anomaly Detection of Prefixes in Event Streams using Autoencoders
This repository contains code and resources for performing anomaly detection in event streams using autoencoders with two different encoding methods: 
1. **One-Hot Encoding**: In this approach, each event is represented as a one-hot vector.

2. **Word2Vec Encoding**: This method uses Word2Vec embeddings to represent events and their attributes.

Our framework is visualised below:

## In order to run the code, please follow the below steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install the requirements (python - 3.11.5)
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Notebooks for reproducing the results presented in the paper.
